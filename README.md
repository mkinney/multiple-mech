Experimentation with multiple instances using [Mech](https://github.com/mechboxes/mech) which allows you to do command line interactions with local VMware instances.

Note: Current `mech` version does not support multiple instances in the same Mechfile, but if you put
a Mechfile in a separate directory, you can spin up multiple VMs quickly and in *parallel*.

To get started:

    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install mech

Run any of these commands:

    ./up
    ./down
    ./destroy

Common commands:

    mech global-status
    mech ls
    
    
Note: The reason for the bash in the scripts like `up` is because I wanted to `time` how long it would take to spin up the instances in parallel, like this:

    time ./up

    real	0m57.409s
    user	0m11.863s
    sys	0m2.375s

Which is faster than not sending the `mech up` commands to the background:

    real	2m29.214s
    user	0m11.259s
    sys	0m2.116s


Created the `Mechfile` in each instances directory by running a `mech init` command like this:

    mech init bento/ubuntu-18.04
